    <h2>About me</h2>
    <P>
      Hi there! I'm Pablo and I am learning to be a web developer. I come from
      Spain, but moved around when I was a kid, including Brussels, Madrid and
      Berlin. I finished school in Madrid and decided to move to Berlin to study
      civil engineering.
    </P>
    <P>
      Fast-forward ten years: I have a BSc in civil engineering but work as an
      admissions manager at ESMT Berlin, an international business school.
      Having always had a hunger for tech and a deep curiosity for how things
      work, I begin looking for a way to shift my career into something
      technical. The Coding Bootcamp seems like a perfect match. And here I am -
      two months into the bootcamp and enjoying every day of it. As I progress
      through the program, you too should be able to see my progress reflected
      on this portfolio page. If you want to reach me, you can do so on{" "}
