        I'm Pablo and I am learning web development. I come from Spain, but
        moved around quite a bit when I was a kid, having lived for a few years
        in Germany, Belgium and Spain. Once I did my Abitur at the German School
        in Madrid, I moved to Berlin to study Civil Engineering at the Berlin
        Institute of Technology.

        Fast-forward ten years: I work as an Admissions Manager for the Degree
        Programs team at ESMT Berlin, an international business school ranked
        amongst the top 10 European Business Schools. My main work consists of
        advising, screening and interviewing candidates for the Degree Programs
        offered at ESMT Berlin.

        Having always had a hunger for tech and a deep curiosity for how things
        work, I begin looking for a way to shift my career into something
        technical. I enrolled in the 24-week fullstack part-time coding bootcamp
        offered by Trilogy and completed it, devoting most of my evenings and
        weekends to learning about modern web development. I am now looking for
        any opportunity to get started in the WebDev field!

        I am passionate about learning and technology. I love tinkering with
        things (both in the virtual and real world) and am no stranger to the
        command line, as well as different OS environments (I grew up using
        MacOS, Windows and Ubuntu). In real life, I like to play the bass
        (inlcuding tinkering with the tuning, action, pickups), ride my bike,
        play videogames and am an avid sci-fi reader.
