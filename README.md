# My homepage

My own homepage was built using [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/), which is a static site generator that uses React and GraphQL under the hood. Features gatsby-image for all images on the site, which loads them progressively. Very fast page loads!

My main focus for this project:

1. fast, simple site, both to visit as well as to maintain
1. no fancy animations, transitions, or crazy UI/UX - I just want to share a bit of information about myself as well as a collection of my most recent projects.

## Deployment

My page is deployed to my [own personal URL](https://pfdzm.me/).
